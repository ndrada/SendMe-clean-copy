WeTransfer inspired web app. Upload your files (up to 5GB), receive a link, paste it in a browser and your files download grouped in a zip. Files delete automatically within 24h (rule set through google buckets). Backend deployed with Render (free version, so if it's your first time using it, give it like 50-60 seconds to load), frontend deployed with Netlify. Thanks! Happy sharing!
